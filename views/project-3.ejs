                    Moncho Park is a web application that highlights the Moncho skatepark in San Ramón, Costa Rica.
                    Users can explore the park’s features, facilities, and events through an interactive and
                    user-friendly interface.

                <p>
                    Managing dynamic content and ensuring a smooth responsive design across devices were key challenges.
                    Careful planning was needed to maintain performance and functionality throughout the project.

                <p>
                    The app is deployed on Vercel, with optimized images and clean code structure to provide fast
                    loading times and a good user experience.

                <p>
                    Basic SEO practices were applied, such as semantic HTML and descriptive alt texts for images.
                    Keyboard navigation is supported for accessibility.

                    This was an individual project where I took care of the design, development, and deployment. The
                    design was inspired by modern skatepark websites. The project is still under construction and
                    more features will be added soon.
