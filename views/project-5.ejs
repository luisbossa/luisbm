                <p>
                    This is a modern clothing store website inspired by French and luxury fashion brands.
                    It offers a clean and elegant user interface, allowing users to explore a variety of clothing
                    products.

                <h4 class="section-title">Development Challenges</h4>
                <p>
                    One challenge was building the product filter system by categories and integrating a working search
                    bar. Another complex part was developing the shopping cart functionality.

                <h4 class="section-title">Performance & Deployment</h4>
                <p>
                    The site is deployed on Vercel. I optimized images and scripts to ensure fast loading time
                    and good performance on all devices.

                <h4 class="section-title">SEO & Accessibility</h4>
                <p>
                    Basic SEO features were added such as meta tags, alt attributes for images, and proper HTML
                    structure.
                    The website supports keyboard navigation and screen readers for accessibility.

                <p>
                    I developed this project independently. I worked on the design, front-end logic, and deployment
                    process.
                    Node.js was also added to prepare for future integration with a payment system.
